Includes an example of how the dialog system might work with a top-down RPG. However, it is easily used for other styles of games as well with minor to no modification, eg. visual novels, etc.

## Getting Started with Dialog
Navigate to `UI\dialog\dialog.tscn` to see how the dialog system works.

You add dialog to your game via .json file, currently stored in `Data\Dialogue.json`.

Three examples of adding dialog to your game:
```
"robust_text_id" : {
	"name": "Qin Tina", 
	"icon": "most_beautiful_being", 
	"voice": "sparkly",
	"text": ["This is the most feature-rich dialog with choices you can make.",
               "Don't you think this is so cool?!?"], 
	"choices": [ 
			{"text" : "Agreed.", "next" : "text_id_if_agree", "action": ["show confetti"]},
			{"text" : "Disagreed.", "next" : "text_id_if_disagree", "action": ["go to jail"],
                "show_only_if": "player status insane"}
		],
	"action" : ["screen shake", "play_sound cheering"]
	},

"conditional_text_id" : {
	"text": ["You can move to the next dialog text depending on in-game variables."], 
	"next": [{"id": "text_id", "if": "already talked"},
            {"id": "other_text_id", "if": "has 5 specific_items"},
            "fallthrough_text_id"],
	},

"simple_text_id": {
	"text": ["This is the simplest dialog you can make."]
	},
```

You can also create custom dialog in-game by creating dialog text in the format specified above and adding it to `db_dialog`, a database of all dialogs. This will allow for easier creation of dynamic text that might display in-game variables, but will need some set-up to generate the entry.

Use `"actions"` to execute external events, which currently occur at the beginning of the dialog.

`‚Äúchoices‚Äù` sets buttons that players can select, and their selection may lead them to different dialogue by setting `‚Äúnext‚Äù` text_id. (This is branching dialogue.) You can nest actions in this to execute so that it executes only if the player selects this choice.

You can add in commonly used variables in dialog using reserved special characters. For instance, if the player name is John Smith:
```
"text_id": {
	"text": ["Hello, &."]
	},
```
will display in game as
```
Hello, John Smith.
```
You can also dynamically control text speed in a single dialog:
```
"text_id": {
	"text": ["I'm s|t|u|t|t|e|r|i|n|g. This ||| is a longer pause."]
	},
```
will add pauses where the reserved special character `|`.

Code is easily modifiable to change reserved character, and to add more special characters with custom behaviors.

## Getting Started with Voices
It is easy to create new typewriter-style voices yet there is a lot of nice variability in sound possible. You can make new voices using .json file:

```
"narrator" : {"rate" : 4, "pitch": 1.5, "pitch_range" : 0.2 },
"bird" : {"rate" : 4, "sound" : "chirp", "pitch": 1, "pitch_range" : 0.2 },
```

`rate` : The rate at which a sound is played counted in sound per letters + 1, such as every letter, or every 5th letter. Bigger rates lead to less frequently played typewriter sound.

`pitch` : The pitch at which to play the sound.

`pitch_range`: A random ¬± amount in which the pitch can fluctuate. Bigger pitch range leads to more natural song-like voices while lower pitch range sound more monotonous.

`sound` (optional): The sound to play in the typewriter effect, matching the name of the respective preloaded sound in the `dialogue_voice.gd` in `Dialog.tscn`. If no sound is specified, it uses a default sound.

## Adding Character Icons
Navigate to the `Icon` node at `TextBox/Margin/HBox/PanelContainer/Icon` under the `dialog.tscn`. Simple add your animations there. For simplicity, it is currently an AnimatedSprite, so please use frame-by-frame animation such as with a spritesheet. Make sure the name of the animation is the same as the name you use as value under the `"icon"` key in your dialogue .json file.

## Customizing the Dialog System to Fit YOUR Game
Inevitably, you may want to change the style of the dialog system to fit your game. I'll list a few tips as to how you might change the code best:

### I want my own dialog panel styles.
Navigate to the `dialog.tscn`. Under current PanelContainers, change the panel style used under `custom_styles/panel`. Change the theme of the root Dialog node. You can also add a NinePatchRect as children of the PanelContainers to change dialog panel texture if you prefer.

### I'm making a visual novel style dialog and want character portraits to have transition animatons (or some other fancy animation)
Currently, I use an AnimatedSprite as the character icon for simplicity. If you'd like to add transition animations (fade in/out, slide in/out, etc.) simply attach an AnimationPlayer to the icon. Feel free to define an extra "animation" key in dialog_db and add code to start an animation accordingly.

### I want character icons and buttons to be in a different position/location.
Luckily, this is an incredibly easy change! Godot's [control nodes](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/ui_introduction_to_the_ui_system.html) make this even easier. Let's say you want to change icon location to be inside the box on the left, instead of the right. It's as easy as just swapping the order of the textbox and icon nodes -- no code change needed! If you wanted animated icons to be placed under the textbox instead of in it, then you simply move the icon node outside of the control nodes to your preferred location and update the node path in `dialog.gd` to point to the right node.

You can also change the type of containers! For instance, you can use a GridContainer instead of the current VBox if you wanted each choice button to be formatted in a grid instead of a column.

</p>

### I want to define my own custom actions to be executed during dialog.
Navigate to `Gamesrc/Globals.gd` and look at the `execute` function. At the beginning of dialog, it will call this function with each act in actions to execute.

For actions like ‚Äúshake screen‚Äù, ‚Äúplay_anim animation‚Äù, and ‚Äúplay_sound sound‚Äù, it will emit a signal to make cinematic stuff happen. With some other functions like ‚Äúplayer inventory add 1 mochi‚Äù or ‚Äúdata set talked_to_NPC true‚Äù it will directly modify in game variables. Feel free to edit this code to add any actions you think your game will commonly use during dialogue.

### I want the next indicator to look different when it's the end of the dialog.
Use an AnimatedSprite and/or AnimationPlayer to change the animation/sprite depending on where you are in the dialog. Navigate to `continue_dialog()` in `dialog.gd` and play animation accordingly. I have commented the code well so you should know which block to put it in.

### I have something else I want to do, but I'm not sure how to do it. Is this possible with your dialog system?
Anything is possible with a bit of work! :) If you're stuck, though, I'd love to help you learn. Feel free to message me and I'd be happy to take a look when I have time.

## FAQ
### ‚ùì Why are you editing dialog via a .json file?
I find .json the fastest to edit and manipulate, since it's basically a text file. No need for graph nodes or other visual UI that gets cluttered when the game grows large. 

However, it is admittedly error-prone if you mistype something. Adding error-checking is something I plan on doing in the future.

I do understand editing dialogue via something more visual would be a nice feature though. There are many great visual dialogue editors available that output .json files:
* [Dialogue Designer](https://www.gamedev.net/projects/2382-dialogue-designer/)
* [Levrault Dialogue Editor](https://github.com/Levrault/LE-dialogue-editor)
* [Whiskers](https://github.com/littleMouseGames/whiskers)

Remember that all you really need is a .json file in the right format, so a dialogue designer for any game engine or story format that outputs to the correct format will work -- do not limit yourself to Godot. In fact, I chose to use a .json file instead of in-game engine specific files as the dialogue data to be compatible with most editors, game engines, and other tools -- if you ever chose to move your game from Godot to another engine, using a Godot-specific dialogue database would've proved to be a massive waste of time and resource.

While it may need some editing to work with my particular dialogue file, it is a good starting point. Please let me know if you would be interested in a visual editor for my dialogue system and I would be happy to look further into developing one suitable to use with this.

### ‚ùì Why did you show source code for a top-down RPG, rather than just the dialog system?
I wanted to show an example of how the dialog system may be used as part of a game, and how well it can integrate into game mechanics. It's easy to find open source dialog systems for Godot that shows you how to display text. The hard part is how you can make the dialog integrate well into your game, and respond to in-game conditions, without requiring a whole bunch of repetitive and extra code.

The code and files are also well separated and organized -- dialogue-system specific files are under `UI\dialog`. You are free to ignore the other code and peer into that only if you'd like.

### ‚ùì Why isn't this a plugin?!?!
Personally, I found project source files rather than plugins easier to understand and emulate when I just got started learning Godot. Plugins are also harder to fully customize/edit to your game style, as the code is often hidden and certain options will not be customizable unless the plugin explicitly allows for it.

If you feel a plugin would be more useful, though, please message me and I will consider making one in the future if enough people are interested.
