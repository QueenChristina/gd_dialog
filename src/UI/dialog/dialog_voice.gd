DialogSound
A basic "typewriter" voice-sound synthesis for the text dialog.

For more advanced voice synthesis and options, I recommend you check out: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/GameAudio/comments/2xogzh/procedural_generation_of_speechlike_audio/
https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/5hjo8n/dialogue_sound_effects_replacement_for_voice/

For instance, you may keep a dictionairy or json of each possible syllable
and make a sound each syllable, or voice each letter and make a sound based on that.

Dependencies: Global.db_voices
